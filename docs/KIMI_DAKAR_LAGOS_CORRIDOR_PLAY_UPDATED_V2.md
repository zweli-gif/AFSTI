## With Real Data from Source Files + Onions Added, Palm Oil Removed

**Date:** 25 February 2026  
**Status:** Updated per AFSTI_DATA_COLLECTION_BRIEF_V2

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Corridor Play:** Dakar-Lagos "Protein & Fresh Food Belt"
- **Total Investment:** $74-150M across 6 components
- **Hero Investment:** CIV Tilapia Aquaculture ($16-25M) — **REFERENCE CASE ONLY**
- **Confirmed Commodities:** Tomato, Onions, Sunflower Oil, Rice, Wheat, Soya, Poultry
- **Conditional:** Mango
- **Spine Enabler:** ColdChainCo ($10-15M)
- **Thesis:** ColdChainCo shared infrastructure makes ALL commodity ICs bankable
- **Addressable Market:** $3.5B+ (Fish $841M + Tomato $360M + Onions $300M + Mango $50-100M)

**Key Update:** Palm oil **REMOVED** (shelf-stable, doesn't benefit from cold chain, 91% artisanal production)

## COMMODITY STATUS SUMMARY (per V2 Brief)

| # | Commodity | Corridor | Status | Cold Chain Fit |
|---|-----------|----------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Tomato / Tomato Paste | Dakar-Lagos | ✅ Confirmed | High (40-50% post-harvest loss) |
| 2 | **Onions** | Dakar-Lagos | ✅ **Confirmed (NEW)** | High (40% loss → <10% with cold storage) |
| 3 | Sunflower Oil | Upper Rift | ✅ Confirmed | Medium |
| 4 | Rice | Upper Rift / Dakar-Lagos | ✅ Confirmed | Low |
| 5 | Wheat | Limpopo | ✅ Confirmed | Low |
| 6 | Soya (oil + meal) | Lobito | ✅ Confirmed | Low |
| 7 | Poultry | Lobito + Limpopo | ✅ Confirmed | High (fresh premium) |
| 8 | Mango | Dakar-Lagos | ⚠️ Conditional | High (40% loss, seasonal) |
| 9 | **Aquaculture (fish)** | Dakar-Lagos | 📋 **Reference case only** | High (template for other ICs) |

**DROPPED:** ~~Palm oil~~ — shelf-stable, no cold chain benefit, 91% artisanal, declining net imports

## PART 1: THE "WAVE OF A PEN" PRICE FRAMEWORK

### Concept

For every commodity × corridor combination, decompose the import price into layers of advantage that corridor trade captures automatically. **"Starting from the CIF import price in the demand market, how much margin does corridor proximity create — before we even discuss production?"**

### The 5 Structural Advantages

#### Layer 1: WORKING CAPITAL SAVING (biggest hidden advantage)

**Formula:**
```
Working Capital Saving ($/t) = Commodity Price × Interest Rate × (Ocean Days - Corridor Days) / 365
```

**Example (soya oil, Zambia → DRC):**
- Commodity price: $1,200/t
- DRC commercial interest rate: ~22%
- Ocean days (Argentina → Matadi): 55 days
- Corridor days (Lusaka → Lubumbashi): 7 days
- **Saving: $1,200 × 0.22 × (55-7) / 365 = $34.70/t**

#### Layer 2: TRANSPORT COST SAVING (proximity premium)

**Formula:**
```
Transport Saving ($/t) = Ocean Freight CIF − Corridor Transport Cost
```

#### Layer 3: TARIFF PREFERENCE (the pen stroke)

**Formula:**
```
Tariff Saving ($/t) = CIF Price × (MFN Tariff Rate − Preferential Rate)
```

#### Layer 4: AGILITY / CONVENIENCE PREMIUM (speed-to-market)

Traders pay $20-50/t premium for supply that responds in days vs months.

#### Layer 5: BORDER FRICTION REDUCTION (the other pen stroke)

**Formula:**
```
Border Friction Cost ($/t) = Delay Cost (truck idle × daily rate) + Informal Payments + SPS Fees + Docs
```

|-----------|------|---------|-----|------|-----------|
| **Yalelo (Zambia)** | International — Proven | $18M DFI, 18K MT/yr, 5-country export, 1,500 jobs | W.Africa expansion logical; Finnfund relationship for co-investment | May not want CIV exposure | AFSTI de-risks first 3 years |
| **Tropo Farms (Ghana)** | International — Regional | Largest W.Africa tilapia farm, Lake Volta operations | Could replicate in CIV ZEAD zones; 2-3 hour flight from Abidjan | Ghana-focused, lacks CIV govt ties | AFSTI provides policy bridge |
| **Local CIV Cooperative** | Local — Community | 50-100 existing farmers near ZEAD zone with road access | Lowest cost structure; Govt/PSTACI alignment; Community ownership | Management capacity, governance | AFSTI provides PMO + technical assistance |
| **Emerging CIV Entrepreneur** | Local — Growth | 500+ MT operator, ambitious scale-up | Local ownership = strongest govt support; Entrepreneurial energy; Lower overhead | Unproven at scale, thin balance sheet | Structured equity + mentorship programme |

## TABLE 16: BINDING CONSTRAINTS FRAMEWORK (from aquaculture_binding_constraints_v02.pptx)

### The Six Constraints (in order of priority)

| Priority | Constraint | Current State | Binding? | AFSTI Solution |
|----------|-----------|---------------|----------|----------------|
| **#1** | **Fingerlings (Fry)** | CNRA capacity grossly insufficient; High larval mortality; No commercial hatchery | **BINDING** | Commercial hatchery ($3-5M) with ProDeCAP |
| **#2** | **Feed Supply** | Imported $0.82/kg; Local artisanal low quality; De Heus exists but needs aquafeed line | **BINDING** | Aquafeed co-investment ($2-4M) with De Heus/Aller Aqua |
| **#3** | **Production Scale** | 1,800 farms averaging <1 MT each; No anchor enterprise | **FOLLOWS #1+#2** | Anchor farm + outgrowers ($5-8M) |
| **#4** | **Cold Chain** | Near-zero for fish; ~25% post-harvest loss | **PHASE 2** | ColdChainCo ($10-15M) - separate investment |
| **#5** | **Corridor Transport** | Trucks exist, no reefer fleet; $0.18/kg Abidjan-Lagos | **PHASE 2** | Reefer fleet ($3-4M) |
| **#6** | **End Market** | $3.5B import market; Lagos/Accra ready buyers | **READY** | Blended offtake contracts |

**Key Insight:** Fingerlings (#1) and Feed (#2) are the ROOT binding constraints. Production (#3) cannot scale without them. Cold chain (#4) and aggregation only matter AFTER production reaches scale. This is the lesson of Yalelo: solve inputs first, production follows, infrastructure last.

| Niger Political Instability (onions) | Diversify to Nigeria (Sokoto, Kebbi) and Burkina sources; Build buffer stocks | Shift to EU imports temporarily; Delay onion investment |
| Feed Price Volatility | 3-year price lock with De Heus; Strategic soy inventory; Alternative proteins | Reduce FCR through genetics; Blend lower-cost feeds |
| Border Closure | Diversify routes (Togo, Ghana ports); Pre-position inventory at Hub 2 | Air freight for premium products; Domestic market absorption |
| Cash Flow Timing | Working capital facility ($2-3M); Phased CAPEX; Grant funding front-loaded | Draw on contingency; Delay non-essential spending |

## KEY CHANGES FROM V1 TO V2

| Change | From V1 | To V2 | Rationale |
|--------|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Palm Oil** | Confirmed commodity | **❌ REMOVED** | Shelf-stable (no cold chain benefit); 91% artisanal production; declining net imports |
| **Onions** | Not included | **✅ ADDED** | 40% post-harvest loss → <10% with cold chain; proven trade flow (Niger → Ghana); $107M+ market |
| **Mango** | Not included | **⚠️ CONDITIONAL** | 40% loss, seasonal (Mar-Jul); include if ColdChainCo utilisation needs it |
| **Aquaculture** | Hero IC | **📋 REFERENCE ONLY** | Template for other ICs; financial model V4 serves as template |
| **ColdChainCo** | Fish + Palm Oil + Tomato | **Fish + Tomato + Onion + Mango** | Palm oil removed; onions added as primary seasonal commodity |
| **Addressable Market** | ~$3B | **~$3.5-4.0B+** | Onions add $300M; mango adds $50-100M |
