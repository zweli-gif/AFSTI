# AFSTI Repository Document Overview

## AFSTI Landing Page Build Prompt
- Defines a single-file HTML/CSS/JS dashboard landing page for the AFSTI HOME tab, aimed at decision-makers and designed to communicate the investment case within 60 seconds.
- Specifies exact design tokens (colors, typography, spacing), sticky navigation behavior, and section-by-section narrative/content requirements.
- Includes data requirements for corridor comparisons, investment/trade multipliers, readiness heatmap, implementation phases, and call-to-action content.

## Kimi Document (Dakar-Lagos Corridor Play Updated V2)
- Captures a corridor investment play with an updated commodity scope: onions added, palm oil removed, and aquaculture retained as a reference-case template.
- Frames the core thesis around shared cold chain infrastructure as a bankability enabler across multiple commodities.
- Summarizes indicative corridor investment range ($74-150M), key enablers, and supporting financial/model assumptions for the aquaculture reference case.
